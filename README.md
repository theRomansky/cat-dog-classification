**Cat-Dog Image Classifier**

This project is a work in progress aimed at developing a machine learning model to classify images of cats and dogs. The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashfakyeafi/cat-dog-images-for-classification).

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to improve the classifier's performance and expand its capabilities.
